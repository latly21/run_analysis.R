The run_analysis.R script downloads a zip file and manipulates the data. The scripts ability to manipulate the data should demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

######Get the data

1. Download the file into the data folder. These are the files that were used:

* Test files:
   * x_test.txt
   * y_test.txt
* Train files:
   * x_train.txt
   * y_train.txt
* Subject files:
   * subject_test.txt
   * subject_train.txt

2. Read the data from the files into variables.
   * y_test_data
   * y_train_data
   * x_test_data
   * x_train_data
